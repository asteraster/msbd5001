The dataset provides the average traffic speed per hour for a major road in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2018. 
Part of the dataset is provided as the training data, and the task is to predict the rest. 
80% of the dataset is provided as the training data and 20% as the testing data, including the timestamp and the corresponding average speed.

I seperate the code to 3 parts:
Feature engineering into year month day weekday and hour
Model training for KNN and linear regressions
Model performance of RMSE part
